        <h1>Wild Brook Trout Streams of Connecticut</h1>
        <h2>Developed By Mary Becker @ UKY New Maps Plus</h2>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="first-column">
                <p>
                    <i>Salvelinus fontinalis</i> (eastern wild brook trout) is one of very few native cold water fish species in the
                    State of Connecticut (CT) (Beauchene et al. 2014).  Cold water fish populations are under great threat in
                    the CT due to stream flow and temperature modification caused by land use, fragmented populations from dams and
                    culverts, climate change and introduction of exotic species.  Wild brook trout have been observed in
                    drainage basins that include 3,238 stream miles (approximate 1/4 of all CT stream miles). Approximately 1/3 of that habitat
                    (1,036 stream miles) is stressed due to human alterations.
                </p>
                <h2>Chidsey Brook</h2>
                <p>
                    Chidsey Brook is an example of a stressed site.  It has been frequently observed dry during summer months
                    due to over-pumping of public water supply wells near the streams.  Stressed streams like Chidsey need immediate
                    management to restore and protect native Connecticut species like the Wild Brook Trout.

                <h3>Data analysis</h3>
                <p>
                    This project conducts a landscape level analysis to identify streams with
                    current and historic wild brook trout populations in CT and prioritize stream management strategies based
                    on a Connecticut-based index of watershed integrity (IWI). Watershed integrity is the capacity of a watershed
                    to support and maintain the full range of ecological processes and function essential to sustainability.
                    Flotemersch et al. (2016) proposed and Thornbrugh et al. (2018). mapped an IWI for the U.S. based on six ecological
                    processes and functions:  hydrologic regulation, regulation of water chemistry, sediment regulation, hydrologic connectivity,
                    temperature regulation, and habitat provision.  A similar Connecticut specific IWI was developed as part of the
                    recently adopted Connecticut Stream flow Regulations.  The index is a collective measure of the
                    degree to which human-related alterations have affected these ecological processes and functions.
                    The index ranges from 0 to 1 where 0 is a an unaltered site and 1 is a highly stressed site.  The map above displays wild brook
                    trout habitat as the watershed upstream of high densities of wild brook trout popultations.  High density wild brook trout
                    populations are defined as sites where observed samples contained greater than 73 wild brook trout per hectare.  Samples were
                    collected by the CT DEEP Monitoring and Assessment Program and Inland Fisheries Program from 1989 - 2017.  Site with higher
                    levels of stress should be prioritize for restoration, while sites with low levels of stress should be prioritized for protection.
