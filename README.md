# CT Critical Freshwater Habitat

A recent [United Nations report](https://www.ipbes.net/global-assessment-biodiversity-ecosystem-services)
by the Intergovenmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (2019)
documented a disturbing trend of an unprecedented rapid decline in biodiversity around the world over the past 50 years.
This loss is a direct result of human-driven drivers, such as land-use change, climate change and direct harvest of
species. A key recommendation for future policy decisions is to better integrate resource manage and landscape
planning across scales.

*Salvelinus fontinalis* (eastern wild brook trout)(eastern wild brook trout) are one of very few native cold water fish species in the
State of Connecticut (CT) (Beauchene et al. 2014).  Cold water fish populations are under great threat in
the CT due to stream flow and temperature modification caused by land use, fragmented populations from dams and
culverts, climate change and introduction of exotic species.  Since 1989, wild brook trout have been observed in
drainage basins that include 3,238 stream miles (approximate 1/4 of all CT stream miles). Approximately 1/3 of that habitat
(1,036 stream miles) is stressed due to human alterations ([Eastern Brook Trout Venture](https://easternbrooktrout.org/), 2019).

This project conducts a landscape level analysis to identify streams with
current and historic wild brook trout populations in CT and prioritize stream management strategies based
on a Connecticut-based index of watershed integrity (IWI). Watershed integrity is the capacity of a watershed
to support and maintain the full range of ecological processes and function essential to sustainability.
Flotemersch et al. (2016) proposed and Thornbrugh et al. (2018). mapped an IWI for the U.S. based on six ecological
processes and functions:  hydrologic regulation, regulation of water chemistry, sediment regulation, hydrologic connectivity,
temperature regulation, and habitat provision.  A similar Connecticut specific IWI was developed as part of the
recently adopted Connecticut Stream flow Regulations.  The index is a collective measure of the
degree to which human-related alterations have affected these ecological processes and functions.
The index ranges from 0 to 1 where 0 is a an unaltered site and 1 is a highly stressed site.  The map displays wild brook
trout habitat as the watershed upstream of high densities of wild brook trout popultations.  High density wild brook trout
populations are defined as sites where observed samples contained greater than 73 wild brook trout per hectare.  Samples were
collected by the CT DEEP Monitoring and Assessment Program and Inland Fisheries Program from 1989 - 2017.  Site with higher
levels of stress should be prioritize for restoration, while sites with low levels of stress should be prioritized for protection.
